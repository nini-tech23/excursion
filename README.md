# Excursion Web Page Project

Welcome to the Excursion web page project! In this project, I created a captivating landing page to advertise a mobile app called "Excursion" by utilizing my skills in HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface (CLI), Git, and GitHub.

## Project Overview

The web page will serve as a marketing tool for the Excursion app, designed to  users record and share their experiences. By incorporating video and landscape imagery, we aim to create an immersive experience for potential customers and entice them to explore the features of the app.

- HTML: For structuring the content of the web page.
- CSS: For styling and enhancing the visual appeal of the page.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): To interact with our local development environment.
